monitor-twitter
===============

monitor-twitter is a command line script to search tweets from a selected user (or the whole tweetuniverse) for certain keywords, and display the last result in a nice Growl notification. Combine it with Cron to constantly monitor your search.

monitor-twitter also stores the last result on Redis so it won't be displayed again.


Usage
-----

monitor-twitter --from USERNAME --keywords KEYWORD1,KEYWORD2,KEYWORD3
